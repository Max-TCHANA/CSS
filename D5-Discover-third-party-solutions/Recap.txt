Recap

There are many front-end frameworks to choose from, including plenty that don't appear in this chapter! 
However, they often offer similar features: easy grid systems, responsiveness, etc. 
Using them is a great way to ensure consistency among your pages and default styles that don't require much work.

Nonetheless, nothing beats knowing pure CSS tools that don't require frameworks, like basic layout properties, Flexbox, and CSS Grid.
The more you master pure CSS, the more you'll be able to harness the power of external tools like Bootstrap, 
Bulma, and Foundation in order to adapt them to your particular needs.
