Recap

Use the  height  and  width  properties to size elements in pixels, em/rem, or percentages. 

Padding and borders are added to the height and width; 
to include them in the overall size of the element, use the  box-sizing  property and set it to  border-box . 

Use  max-width  ,  max-height  ,  min-width  , and  min-height  to ensure that elements never go above or below a certain size.
