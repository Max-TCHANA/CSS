Recap
Use  grid-template-areas  with  grid-template  to set layouts visually in your code.  


In summary:
Set the number of columns and rows, and their measurements, 
in grid-template (or separately in grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows).

Define a template using letters, words, or numbers of your choice in grid-template-areas, 
putting a space between each and putting each row in a set of quotation marks.

Map elements to these letters, words, or numbers of your choice by defining grid-area on each element.
