Recap
Each HTML element has a border.

To set the width of a border, use  border-width  and define the size with pixels, em/rem, or special CSS words (thin, medium, thick).

To set the style, use  border-style  and choose a style from the list of available CSS words.  

To set the color, use  border-color  and use either hex, RGB, or RGBA color codes. 

To set width, style, and color all at once, use the  border  property.

To set individual borders, use top, right, left, and bottom (ex.  border-top-style ).

To curve the corners of a border, use  border-radius  .
