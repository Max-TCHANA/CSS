Recap
This was a tough chapter, so let's sum up what we covered:

Media queries allow the loading of various CSS styles based on certain settings.

There are a large number of settings allowed by media queries: number of colors, screen resolution, orientation, etc. 
In practice, they are mostly used to change the website's appearance for different screen resolutions.

You create a media query with the  @media  directive followed by the screen type and one or more conditions (such as the maximum screen width). 
The following CSS style will be enabled only if the conditions are met.

Mobile browsers simulate a screen width: this is called the viewport.

Smartphones can be targeted by a rule based on the actual number of pixels displayed on the screen:  max-device-width.
