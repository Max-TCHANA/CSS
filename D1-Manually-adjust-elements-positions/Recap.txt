Recap

While setting positions using relative, absolute, or fixed values may seem like a straightforward idea, 
you'll sometimes find these solutions to be outdated. They are also easily broken. 
They don't respond to different screen sizes, meaning you need to hardcode the values you want in 
different media queries for different screen sizes. You'll rarely want the same positioning for an element on 
a desktop and on a mobile device.

Nonetheless, you'll see this kind of code in older code bases or in situations where there was no other option 
for positioning an element in a linear, grid-oriented way.
