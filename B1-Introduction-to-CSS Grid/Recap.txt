CSS Grid is a set of CSS properties that allow creation of two-dimensional layouts defined by columns and rows.

Instead of having to manually set an element's position using pixel distances and complicated math 
(which is the way things used to be!), you can simply set the number of columns and rows you want and let Grid position them for you.

Example: look at the sample file: To keep things simple, we'll use colorful blocks that could represent articles, photos,
 or whatever you'd end up putting in your own project.

CSS Grid is very powerful. It can also be used in combination with the concepts like padding, borders, and margins.

Note: in order for CSS Grid to work with Internet Explorer, you must preface your grid rules with -ms.
There is a lot of good advice on this on the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN).
